# Tic-Tac-Toe-Android

I created a Tic-tac-toe Android application in Android Studio using Kotlin. Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
